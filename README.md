# Restaurant Delivery System
The Restaurant Delivery System is an ongoing project aimed at providing a comprehensive delivery solution for multiple restaurants. The system allows restaurants to register, upload their products, and fetch products from existing platforms such as Glovo, Deliveroo, and Just Eat. The application also incorporates device verification to ensure that only registered devices can access the app. Additionally, it provides functionality to open and close restaurants, enabling the blocking of orders being placed through the website.

## Features
* Restaurant registration and profile management
* Product uploading and management
* Integration with external platforms (Glovo, Deliveroo, Just Eat) for product fetching
* Device verification for secure access
* Open and close restaurant functionality to control order placement
* Point of Sale (POS) system for live order processing and management
* Table management system for restaurants
* Dashboard with order and customer information
* Date range selection for generating custom reports

The Point of Sale (POS) system is a key component of the Restaurant Delivery System. It provides live fetching, updating, and placing of orders. The system also includes a table management feature that allows restaurant staff to assign orders to specific tables. The POS system facilitates efficient order processing and improves overall restaurant operations.

## Dashboard
The system includes a user-friendly dashboard that provides essential insights and information. With the dashboard, restaurant owners and managers can select a date range and access order and customer information for that period. The dashboard helps in monitoring sales, tracking customer behavior, and making informed business decisions.

## Development with Strapi and React Native
The Restaurant Delivery System is developed using the Strapi framework for the backend and React Native for the mobile application.
